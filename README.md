# Machine-Learning-and-Optimization-Theory

Machine learning and optimization theory is a repository of my theoretical course explaining the fundamentals of machine learning. Optimization theory, linear algebra, high-level calculus and differentiation are the building blocks of machine learning. In this course, I am trying to touch each of these to provide clear understanding about the idea lying behind machine learning. For that purpose, I prepared a presentation together with a coding session of human-brain age prediction by linear regression in JAX. This lecture is created to for 100TUNAI program initiated by [BASIRA-CENTER](https://basira-lab.com). 

* Part 1: Machine Learning and Optimization Theory
* Part 2: JAX Framework
* Part 3: Coding Session for Human-Brain Age Prediction


The presentation prepared for parts 1 and 2 are accessible in this repository as pdf format. The animations in the presentation do not work for its pdf version, so mac-keynote and pptx formats are also added into the [drive folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1xbc07s6rLYEcb4Iy0MP8diB3U39uvfoz?usp=share_link) together with colab and dataset files. For additional JAX tutorials, you can visit my [kaggle notebooks](https://www.kaggle.com/code/goktugguvercin/introduction-to-jax). What the lecture focuses on is briefly illustrated in the following lecture sketch map:
